I focus on blending theoretical insights with practical solutions, designing and implementing cryptographic systems. My goal is to advance both the theory and engineering of cryptography through research and real-world projects. On my GitHub, you&apos;ll find contributions ranging from theoretical work to secure algorithms and systems. I&apos;m always open to collaborations that challenge and expand our understanding of cryptography and mathematics.</subtitle></feed>
